Hello there. My name is Aditya Giri, and welcome to the first ever post on my blog. I've been wanting to start blogging for a long while now. I just used to put it off. So from here on, expect a lot of blogging about functional programming, personal anacdotes and my weekly favorite programming resources.

<!-- more -->

Often times, there will be some of the off-topic blogging regarding politics, YouTube, and Internet in general(yeah, there will be a lot of memes).

So I'm not sure if I want to stretch this more than how much it already is, so, see ya soon.
