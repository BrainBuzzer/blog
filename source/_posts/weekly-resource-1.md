I have read a ton of stuff related to programming this week. So far, whatever I have read has been curated in this list. This list mostly consists of Elixir and Elm programming. I have also included some of the talks that I really loved.

<!-- more -->

Here are a couple of articles that are worth a read for this week:

1. [Track-switching in a large Elixir web application](https://medium.com/9elements/track-switching-in-a-large-elixir-web-application-31522d5ac457)
2. [GRiSP 2 - Bare-Metal Erlang Virtual Machine](https://www.grisp.org/)
3. [Achieving 100k connections per second with **Elixir**](https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/)
4. [Elm Shared State](https://github.com/ohanhi/elm-shared-state)

And now, to the talks. Firstly I had watched the talk given by Joe Armstrong who is one of the creators of Erlang. And he led to really good talks which I will be linking below. Sorry Joe, I won't be including your talk.

1. [Computer for cynics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ3gmh-d9oI)
2. [Free is a lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldhHkVjLe7A)
3. [Winning the war of Error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVkHgKCqAcI)

That is about it for this week's resources. I'll be doing better job from next week to curate resources. Till then, thanks a lot for reading!
