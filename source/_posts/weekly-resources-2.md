This week was really a blast in terms of new things released in the programming world, especially in the niche of Elixir world. Phoenix LiveView was released recently by Chris McCord, and people have built some really good stuff with it already.

<!-- more -->

Here are a couple of articles that are worth a read for this week:

1. [A JavaScript-Free Frontend](https://dev.to/winduptoy/a-javascript-free-frontend-2d3e)
2. [Simple GenServer with periodical callback](https://medium.com/@mrwolf85/simple-genserver-with-periodical-callback-256b39d90f7b)
3. [How Discord Scaled Elixir to 5,000,000 Concurrent Users](https://blog.discordapp.com/scaling-elixir-f9b8e1e7c29b)
4. [What the Hell is going on?](https://www.perell.com/blog/what-the-hell-is-going-on) - This one is not so much related to programming but I really loved this one becuase online activism is really necessary topic in the current day scenario.

I wish to add a lot more to this. I hadn't been able to see any new talks this week, although a lot of them from Lonestar ElixirConf and Lambda Days have been uploaded. But this week, I had heard to a couple of podcasts and I'll just give you the links to them.
5. [What Really Makes Erlang and Elixir Fault Tolerant and Scalable with Francesco Cesarini](https://devchat.tv/elixir-mix/emx-041-what-really-makes-erlang-and-elixir-fault-tolerant-and-scalable-with-francesco-cesarini/)
6. [Elixir Outlaws and Adopting Elixir with Chris Keathley](https://devchat.tv/elixir-mix/emx-040-elixir-outlaws-and-adopting-elixir-with-chris-keathley/)

So that will be it for this week. I'm planning for some tutorial blogs for next week with the Programming Resources one too. So see you then.
